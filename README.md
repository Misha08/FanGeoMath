# The FanGeoMath V 0.43

<!-- The firs text about the end of the work -->
üéâ today I completed my work on this program, the program is built on the principle of the basic geometry of triangles.

<br />
<br />
<!-- The list of the possabilities of my programm -->

### You can select and calculate the principal magnitudes of triangles, for example: 
<ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Areas</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Heights</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Medians</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Bisectors</li>
</ul>

**‚ö†Ô∏è The program is made on the version of Python 3.8 ‚ö†Ô∏è**


Have you ever dreamed of a convenient and well-formed way to calculate the size of triangles? Well, I tried to implement this feature in my program :)

<br />

### The program implements such features as "Entry point", which is rarely put in Python programs:
<br />

```python
if __main__ == "__main__":
    ...
    sys.exit(0)
```


### At the beginning, you are only shown welcome words once, because how can you not greet users:
<br />

```python
if __main__ == "__main__":
    ...
    sys.exit(0)
```
